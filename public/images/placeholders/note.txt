In a production environment, you would have actual image files here such as:

1. movie-backdrop.jpg - A default movie background image
2. movie-poster.jpg - A default movie poster image 
3. mood-*.jpg - Background images for different moods

For development purposes, the application will use the placeholder-backdrop.jpg and placeholder-poster.jpg files in the public directory.
